# Junior AI Lab 

Welcome to the **Junior AI Lab**! This repository is a comprehensive collection of artificial intelligence and data science projects specifically designed for students aged 10-17. It bridges the gap between foundational programming and high-impact real-world AI applications.

##  Mission
Our goal is to empower the next generation of engineers to solve complex social and industrial problems using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**.

##  Curricula Overview

### 🔹 Group A: Junior Explorers (Ages 10-12)
[cite_start]Focuses on the transition from block-based logic (mBlock) to text-based AI foundations[cite: 2, 22].
* [cite_start]**Foundations:** Python syntax, variables, operators, loops (while/for), and functions[cite: 23, 36, 37, 43].
* [cite_start]**AI Logic:** Introduction to Regression (Linear, Multiple, Polynomial, Logistic) and Classification (Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN)[cite: 59, 60, 61, 63, 65, 66, 67].
* [cite_start]**Key Projects:** Hangman, Tic-Tac-Toe, Chatbots, Airbnb Pricing Algorithm, AI Weather App, and Image-based Animal Classification[cite: 46, 48, 53, 68, 70, 71].

### 🔹 Group B: Future Engineers (Ages 13-17)
[cite_start]Advanced implementation of professional AI frameworks and methodologies[cite: 82, 93, 116].
* [cite_start]**Advanced Python:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Management (File I/O & Databases)[cite: 94, 95].
* [cite_start]**Data Science:** Data processing with **Pandas/NumPy** and visualization via **Matplotlib/Seaborn**[cite: 123, 124, 147, 148].
* [cite_start]**Deep Learning & CV:** Building Neural Networks (ANN/CNN) with **TensorFlow/Keras** and real-time image processing with **OpenCV**[cite: 100, 126, 127, 161, 162].
* [cite_start]**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Working with Transformers, GPT, and BERT models to build advanced AI Agents and Chatbots[cite: 119, 131, 169, 170, 173].
